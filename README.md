# Spelling Bee
This is a spelling bee application created for the Amazon Echo device using Alexa Skills Kit. The Amazon Echo device interacts with users through
voice commands. When a user wishes to play spelling bee, the Echo will ask user for spelling difficulties. After choosing a difficulty the user
will be provided a new word. The following are commands available to users: repeat, skip, define, give example, finish game. The commands
allow users to Echo to repeat the word, skip the current word, give definition of the current word, give an example of usage of current word, or to end the game
respectively.

## Installation
To develop for the Amazon Echo, we need to use the Amazon Web Services Lambda service. In AWS console, select Lambda and create new lambda function.
Upload the python file in your new lambda service.
